# Fullstack-App-with-User-Login

A Fullstack Application with user authentication. This app has several features including a Darth Vader and Yoda quotes, with post, delete and update capabilities.

## How It's Made:

**Tech used:** HTML5, CSS3, JavaScript, Node, MongoDB and Express.

My learning was focused on the manipulation of express and connecting my database with CRUD and Authentication capabilities. 

## Optimizations

Playing with the authentication features was fun, however, the importance of having the proper ejs in the right method can break your code. 

## Lessons Learned:

Authentication application can be troublesome if the right method isnt being used.
